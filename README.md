# ‚ú® Solid Rails App <!-- omit in toc -->

Web and REST API application made with [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) + [solid-process](https://github.com/B-CDD/solid-process).

## üôå Repository branches <!-- omit in toc -->

This repository has three branches:
1. [main](https://github.com/B-CDD/solid-rails-app/blob/main/README.md): `95%` Rails way + `5%` solid-process. (**üìç you are here**)
2. [vanilla-rails](https://github.com/B-CDD/solid-rails-app/blob/vanilla-rails/README.md): `100%` Rails way + `0%` solid-process.
3. [solid-process](https://github.com/B-CDD/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process/README.md): `20%` Rails way + `80%` solid-process.

## üì¢ Disclaimer <!-- omit in toc -->

The goal of this branch is to show how the `solid-process` can be progressively introduced into a Rails application (check out the [`User::Registration`](https://github.com/B-CDD/solid-rails-app/blob/main/app/models/user/registration.rb)).

You can use it only where you see fit, and you don't need to choose between one approach (Rails Way) or another (solid-process), as both can coexist in a complementary and friendly way.

## üåü Highlights of what solid-process can bring to you <!-- omit in toc -->

1. The [`solid-process`](https://github.com/B-CDD/solid-process) uses Rails's known components, such as ActiveModel attributes, validations, callbacks, and more. This way, you can use the same tools you are already familiar with.

2. A way for representing/writing critical system operations. It feels like having code that documents itself. You can see the operation's steps, inputs, outputs, side effects, and more in one place.

3. A less coupled codebase, given that this structure encourages the creation of cohesive operations (with a specific purpose), thus reducing the concentration of logic in ActiveRecord models.
    > e.g., several callbacks from the `User` model were replaced by the [`User::Registration`](https://github.com/B-CDD/solid-rails-app/blob/main/app/models/user/registration.rb) process.

4. Standardization of instrumentation and observability of what occurs within each process (Implement a listener to do this automatically and transparently for the developer [[1]](https://github.com/B-CDD/solid-rails-app/blob/main/config/initializers/solid_process.rb) [[2]](https://github.com/B-CDD/solid-rails-app/blob/main/lib/rails_event_logs_logger_listener.rb)). This will help you better understand what is happening within the system.

## System dependencies
* SQLite3
* Ruby `3.2.3`
  * bundler `>= 2.5.6`

## Setup

1. Install system dependencies
2. Create a `config/master.key` file with the following content:
  ```sh
  echo 'a061933f96843c82342fb8ab9e9db503' > config/master.key

  chmod 600 config/master.key
  ```
3. Run `bin/setup`

## How to run the test suite

* `bin/rails test`

## How to run the application locally
1. `bin/rails s`
2. Open in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## API Documentation (cURL examples)

Set the following environment variables to use the examples below:

```bash
export API_HOST="http://localhost:3000"
export API_TOKEN="MY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

You can get the `API_TOKEN` by:
1. Using the below `User / Registration` request.
2. or performing the below `User / Authentication` request.
3. or copying the `access_token` from `Sign In >> Settings >> API` page.
